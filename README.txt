DAT505 Assignment

This project is about the microphone reacting to the loudness of the room, if there's more sound then more buildings will appear and if it's quiet then more trees will appear.
This interpolates noise pollution and how there's more buildings with more people.

This is controlled with a mouse - use left-button to rotate, right-button to move around and middle to zoom in or out.
